# myRTOS

This repository contains authorial "RTOS" implementation called simply myRTOS. It is aimed to be launched on ARM 32-bit microcontrollers (specifically STM32). In fact, it is not full-fledged RTOS - it composed of task context-switching preemptive scheduler and some synchronization and communication primitives (mutexes, FIFOs, etc.).

This project is developed to satisfy my interest in finding out how exacly RTOSes work.
